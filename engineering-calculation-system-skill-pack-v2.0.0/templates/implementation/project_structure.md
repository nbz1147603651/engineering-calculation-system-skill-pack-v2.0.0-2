## Placement Rules

Record where each feature class belongs and which files own formulas, runner orchestration, reports, interfaces, and tests.

Use `webapp/` or `src/<pkg>/interfaces/webapp/` for the unified production frontend. Use `apps/review/` for Marimo review apps. Use `data/` for user-provided, imported, staging, normalized, and package-managed data. Use `outputs/` only for generated artifacts.
