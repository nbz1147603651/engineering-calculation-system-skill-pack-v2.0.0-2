# Unified UI Layout Specification

Use this template for production frontend, review UI, or app-like engineering calculation interfaces.

## Layout Decision

| Item | Selected value | Reason | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Interface family | production frontend / Marimo review / report preview / batch dashboard | to_be_defined | user request |
| Primary user | engineer / checker / approver / batch operator | to_be_defined | workflow |
| Data source | uploaded package / final_input.json / API / batch_control | to_be_defined | import contract |
| Calculation path | run_book(BookInput) -> BookResult | required | code |
| Report preview path | HTML / PDF / DOCX / other | to_be_defined | report context |

## Standard Page Zones

| Zone | Required content | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top bar | project/book title, case selector, status, import, export, report preview | Keep actions predictable across projects. |
| Left input panel | collapsible BookInput groups, units, validation, sticky run/save controls | Do not place result logic here. |
| Right review workbench | governing summary, warnings/errors, result cards, charts, traces | Conclusion first, details below. |
| Modal/drawer | report preview, imported report preview, source trace, formula trace, package validation, diff | Use for deep review without losing context. |
| Status strip | input hash, result hash, runner version, report template version, package id, timestamp | Required for production review. |

## Input Card Pattern

| Card ID | BookInput group | Fields | Validation feedback | Conditional visibility | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| to_be_defined | to_be_defined | to_be_defined | inline / summary | to_be_defined |  |

## Result Card Pattern

| Card ID | BookResult path | Purpose | Displays | Trace expansion | Report visibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| governing | governing | conclusion first | status, governing check, utilization/margin | true | summary |
| warnings_errors | warnings/errors | review blockers | warnings, errors, unresolved assumptions | true | summary |

## Interaction States

| State | Required UI behavior |
| --- | --- |
| no_input | Show import/create options and disabled report export. |
| draft_input | Allow run, save draft, export draft package. |
| validation_error | Show field-level errors and keep run disabled or blocked. |
| calculation_error | Preserve input, show error, do not emit final output. |
| review_result | Show traces, warnings, export review package. |
| final_result | Require saved final input, trusted BookResult, verification evidence. |

## Visual Rules

- Keep the interface dense and work-focused.
- Put inputs on the left and results on the right for desktop layouts.
- On mobile, stack input first, then governing summary, then result details.
- Use clear status text in addition to color.
- Keep formulas and long traces behind expandable detail sections.
- Use tables for comparable engineering checks and compact metric boxes for headline values.
- Provide chart containers only when figures improve engineering review.
